        <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largelyunder the control of real estate
            developers. Construction activities haveresulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the
            Tahoe RegionalPlanning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline and has won twoFederal Supreme
            Court battles over recent decisions. These regulations areunpopular with many residents, especially those in
            the Tahoe LakefrontHomeowners Association.</p>
        <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmentalwatchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for
            50 years. Founded when a proposal to builda four-lane highway around the lake (with a bridge over the
            entrance to EmeraldBay) was proposed in 1957, the League has thwarted poorly designed developmentprojects
            and environmentally unsound planning. The League embraces responsibleand diversified use of the Lake's
            resources while protecting and restoring itsnatural attributes.</p>

        <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) hasbeen measuring stream discharge and
            concentrations of nutrients and sediment inup to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin,
            California-Nevada. Theobjectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water qualityinformation
            necessary to support science-based environmental planning anddecision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a
            cooperative program with supportfrom 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This
            dataset, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, isbeing used by the
            Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop aprogram (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit
            the flux of nutrients andfine sediment to the Lake.</p>
        <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis TahoeEnvironmental Research Center is dedicated
            to research, education and publicoutreach, and to providing objective scientific information for restoration
            andsustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces awell-publicized "State of the Lake"
            assessment report.</p>
